Artificial Intelligence systems have become increasingly involved in our lives. These systems can be used in relatively low-stakes decision making such as recommender systems but they are also used in medical contexts too. More recently, the wider public utilize generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Midjourney to write documents, reports, and emails, or create pictures, and logos to use in various ways. All of these introduce ethical challenges with implications for data ethics, privacy, bias, sustainability, and so on. This course will introduce the ethical implications of artificial intelligence to the students. We will also discuss our role in this and how to take steps to minimize harm as people working with big data and AI (e.g. future researchers, software engineers, or analysts).

* First time offered in Sabanci University.
* Spring 2025 course has 100 undergraduate students with 24 graduate students.
